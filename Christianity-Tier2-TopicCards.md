## 📌 Their Core Claim
> "The Bible is the divinely inspired, inerrant Word of God, preserved perfectly throughout history."

## ⚡ Your Main Counter-Points

### 1. **Manuscript Evidence Shows Late & Fragmentary Sources**
- **Oldest fragment:** P52 (John Rylands Fragment) - Contains only John 18:31-33, 37-38. Dated 125-175 CE (95-145 years after Jesus)
- **Oldest "complete" Gospel:** Papyrus 66 (P66) - Gospel of John, dated ~200 CE (170 years after Jesus)
- **Oldest complete New Testament:** Codex Sinaiticus - Dated ~330-360 CE (300+ years after Jesus), written in Greek
- **Language barrier:** Jesus spoke Aramaic, but NO Aramaic originals exist. All manuscripts are Greek translations
- **No originals:** Not a SINGLE original manuscript exists for any Gospel - only copies of copies of copies
- <span style="color:blue;">**RSV Preface:**</span> "No two manuscripts agree in all particulars" + "deliberate changes were introduced"

### 2. **Gospel Authors UNKNOWN**
- <span style="color:blue;">**RSV Bible admits:**</span> 1 Samuel = "UNKNOWN", 2 Samuel = "UNKNOWN", 1 Kings = "UNKNOWN", etc.
- <span style="color:blue;">**J.B. Phillips (Anglican scholar):**</span> "Scholars nowadays almost all reject" Matthew as author of Matthew
- <span style="color:blue;">**Luke 1:1-3:**</span> Luke admits he compiled from others - not divine inspiration

### 3. **Major Verses FORGED**
- **1 John 5:7** (ONLY Trinity verse): Not in ANY Greek manuscript before 15th century - FORGED!
- **John 7:53-8:11** (woman caught in adultery): Added later, not in original Gospel
- **Mark 16:9-20** (last 12 verses): Oldest manuscripts end at 16:8

### 4. **Massive Textual Problems**
- <span style="color:blue;">**Bart Ehrman (Christian scholar):**</span> "More differences among manuscripts than words in the New Testament"
- <span style="color:blue;">**Dr. John Mill (1707):**</span> 30,000 variations among just 100 Greek manuscripts

### 5. **Biblical Contradictions**
- Who incited David's census? <span style="color:blue;">2 Samuel 24:1 = GOD</span> vs. <span style="color:blue;">1 Chronicles 21:1 = SATAN</span>
- Famine length? <span style="color:blue;">2 Samuel 24:13 = SEVEN years</span> vs. <span style="color:blue;">1 Chronicles 21:12 = THREE years</span>
- Genealogy of Jesus: <span style="color:blue;">Matthew = 26 ancestors through SOLOMON</span> vs. <span style="color:blue;">Luke = 41 ancestors through NATHAN</span>

## 🎯 Best Questions to Ask

1. If the Bible is perfectly preserved, why do Christian scholars admit 50,000 errors?
2. Why was the only explicit Trinity verse (1 John 5:7) forged in the 15th century?
3. If God inspired the Bible, why don't scholars know who wrote most of it?

## 🕌 Islamic Position

<span style="color:green;">**[Quran 2:79]**</span>
> **Arabic:** فَوَيْلٌ لِّلَّذِينَ يَكْتُبُونَ الْكِتَابَ بِأَيْدِيهِمْ ثُمَّ يَقُولُونَ هَـٰذَا مِنْ عِندِ اللَّهِ لِيَشْتَرُوا بِهِ ثَمَنًا قَلِيلًا ۖ فَوَيْلٌ لَّهُم مِّمَّا كَتَبَتْ أَيْدِيهِمْ وَوَيْلٌ لَّهُم مِّمَّا يَكْسِبُونَ
>
> **Translation (Sahih International):** So woe to those who write the "scripture" with their own hands, then say, "This is from Allah," in order to exchange it for a small price. Woe to them for what their hands have written and woe to them for what they earn.

# TOPIC 2: Trinity & Divinity of Jesus

## 📌 Their Core Claim
> "Jesus is God incarnate, the second person of the Holy Trinity (Father, Son, Holy Spirit)."

## ⚡ Your Main Counter-Points

### 1. **Logical Impossibility: God Cannot Be Human**
- **Essential attributes of God are OPPOSITE of human attributes**
- Rules of logic: Something cannot be its opposite
  - Hot is not cold
  - Up is not down
  - Eternal is not temporal
  - All-powerful is not weak
  - All-knowing is not ignorant
- **God cannot do things that contradict His attributes**
  - God cannot do evil (He is perfectly good)
  - God cannot be ignorant (He is all-knowing)
  - God cannot be weak (He is all-powerful)
- If Jesus was hungry, tired, ignorant, and tempted - he had HUMAN attributes, not divine attributes
- Therefore: Jesus cannot be God

### 2. **Jesus Denied Being God**
- <span style="color:blue;">**Jesus:**</span> "The Father is greater than I" (John 14:28)
- <span style="color:blue;">**Jesus:**</span> "I can of mine own self do nothing" (John 5:30)
- <span style="color:blue;">**Jesus:**</span> "Why do you call me good? No one is good but God" (Matthew 19:17)
- <span style="color:blue;">**Jesus:**</span> "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?" (Mark 15:34) - God praying to God?

### 3. **Trinity Was Invented at Church Councils (325-451 CE)**
- **Word "Trinity" NEVER appears in the Bible**
- **Council of Nicea (325 CE):** Emperor Constantine (not bishops) proposed it, threatened exile
- **Council of Constantinople (381 CE):** Holy Spirit as 3rd person established - 300+ years after Jesus!
- **Council of Chalcedon (451 CE):** Hypostatic Union finalized - 400+ years after Jesus
- <span style="color:blue;">**Saint Jerome:**</span> World "awoke with a groan to find itself Arian" (359 CE) - non-Trinitarians were majority

### 4. **The ONLY Trinity Verse Was FORGED**
- **1 John 5:7** (only explicit Trinity statement): Not in any Greek manuscript before 15th century
- Erasmus was pressured to include it - someone manufactured a Greek manuscript!
- Removed from modern translations (RSV, NIV, ESV)

### 5. **Jesus Had Human Limitations (NOT God's Attributes)**
- Hungry, thirsty, sleepy, tired (Matthew 4:2, John 19:28, Luke 8:23, John 4:6)
- Ignorant: Didn't know the Hour (Mark 13:32), didn't know fig season (Mark 11:13)
- Tempted by Satan 40 days (Mark 1:13) - but "God cannot be tempted" (James 1:13)
- Fled, hid from danger (John 7:1, John 10:39, John 11:54)
- Arrested, beaten, condemned (John 18:12, Luke 22:63, Mark 14:64)

### 6. **Leading Christian Scholars Admit Jesus Never Claimed Divinity**
- <span style="color:blue;">**1984 Survey:**</span> Only 11 of 31 Anglican bishops insisted Jesus was God
- <span style="color:blue;">**Archbishop Michael Ramsey:**</span> "Jesus did not claim deity for himself"

## 🎯 Best Questions to Ask

1. If Jesus is God, why did he say "the Father is greater than I"?
2. If Trinity was always believed, why did it take 400 years and imperial threats to formulate it?
3. If Jesus shared God's nature, why was he ignorant, powerless, hungry, tired, and tempted?
4. How can someone who was arrested and beaten be the all-powerful God?

## 🕌 Islamic Position

<span style="color:green;">**[Quran 4:171]**</span>
> **Arabic:** يَا أَهْلَ الْكِتَابِ لَا تَغْلُوا فِي دِينِكُمْ وَلَا تَقُولُوا عَلَى اللَّهِ إِلَّا الْحَقَّ ۚ إِنَّمَا الْمَسِيحُ عِيسَى ابْنُ مَرْيَمَ رَسُولُ اللَّهِ وَكَلِمَتُهُ أَلْقَاهَا إِلَىٰ مَرْيَمَ وَرُوحٌ مِّنْهُ ۖ فَآمِنُوا بِاللَّهِ وَرُسُلِهِ ۖ وَلَا تَقُولُوا ثَلَاثَةٌ ۚ انتَهُوا خَيْرًا لَّكُمْ ۚ إِنَّمَا اللَّهُ إِلَٰهٌ وَاحِدٌ ۖ سُبْحَانَهُ أَن يَكُونَ لَهُ وَلَدٌ ۘ لَّهُ مَا فِي السَّمَاوَاتِ وَمَا فِي الْأَرْضِ ۗ وَكَفَىٰ بِاللَّهِ وَكِيلًا
>
> **Translation (Sahih International):** O People of the Scripture, do not commit excess in your religion or say about Allah except the truth. The Messiah, Jesus, the son of Mary, was but a messenger of Allah and His word which He directed to Mary and a soul [created at a command] from Him. So believe in Allah and His messengers. And do not say, "Three"; desist - it is better for you. Indeed, Allah is but one God. Exalted is He above having a son. To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth. And sufficient is Allah as Disposer of affairs.

# TOPIC 3: Crucifixion & Atonement

## 📌 Their Core Claim
> "Jesus died on the cross as a sacrifice for humanity's sins. His death is necessary for salvation."

## ⚡ Your Main Counter-Points

### 1. **Logical Inconsistency: All-Just God Cannot Forgive Through Sacrifice of Another**
- **Why would an all-just God forgive mankind by sacrificing someone else?**
  - In any human court, punishing an innocent person for the guilty is the definition of INJUSTICE
  - How can God's justice be satisfied by the most unjust act - punishing the innocent for the guilty?
- **Why would God NEED a sacrifice to forgive sins?**
  - Is God unable to forgive directly? That would limit His power
  - Is God unwilling to forgive without blood? That would limit His mercy
  - If God can forgive, why doesn't He just forgive?
- **Vicarious atonement contradicts justice:**
  - Justice means each person receives what they deserve
  - Transferring punishment to an innocent person is the OPPOSITE of justice
- The doctrine makes forgiveness dependent on bloodshed rather than repentance and God's mercy

### 2. **Jesus Prayed Desperately NOT to Die**
- <span style="color:blue;">**Jesus:**</span> "O Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me" (Matthew 26:39) - Repeated 3 times!
- <span style="color:blue;">**Bible:**</span> His prayer was HEARD: "was heard in that he feared" (Hebrews 5:7)
- If Jesus came TO die, why pray desperately NOT to die?

### 3. **Sign of Jonah FAILED - Jesus' Own Prophecy**
- <span style="color:blue;">**Jesus:**</span> "As Jonah was THREE days and THREE nights in the whale, so shall the Son of man be THREE days and THREE nights in the heart of the earth" (Matthew 12:40)
- **Biblical timeline:**
  - Crucified: "Preparation day" = Friday afternoon (Mark 15:42, Luke 23:54, John 19:31, 42)
  - Buried: Friday before sunset (Matthew 27:57-60)
  - Resurrected: Sunday morning, "first day of the week" (Mark 16:9, Matthew 28:1)
- **Actual count:** Friday night + Saturday day + Saturday night = **1 day, 2 nights** (NOT 3 days, 3 nights)
- Jesus' own prophecy failed!

### 4. **Blood Sacrifice Contradicts the Bible**
- <span style="color:blue;">**Ezekiel 18:20:**</span> "The son shall NOT bear the iniquity of the father"
- <span style="color:blue;">**Ezekiel 18:21:**</span> "If the wicked turn from sin and keep My statutes...he shall surely live" - Repentance brings forgiveness, NO sacrifice needed
- <span style="color:blue;">**2 Chronicles 7:14:**</span> "If my people humble themselves, pray, seek my face, turn from wicked ways; I will forgive" - No blood needed
- <span style="color:blue;">**1 Samuel 15:22:**</span> "To obey is better than sacrifice"

### 5. **Jesus Taught Forgiveness WITHOUT Blood Sacrifice**
- <span style="color:blue;">**The Lord's Prayer:**</span> "Forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors" (Matthew 6:12) - No mention of sacrifice
- <span style="color:blue;">**Zacchaeus:**</span> Repented, gave to poor, paid back what he cheated. Jesus: "TODAY salvation has come to this house" (Luke 19:9) - Salvation BEFORE crucifixion!
- <span style="color:blue;">**Nineveh:**</span> 120,000+ people forgiven through repentance and fasting alone (Jonah 3) - No blood sacrifice

### 6. **NO Eyewitness Accounts of the Crucifixion**
- <span style="color:blue;">**Matthew 26:56:**</span> "Then all the disciples forsook him, and FLED"
- <span style="color:blue;">**Mark 14:50:**</span> "And they ALL forsook him, and FLED"
- **The disciples RAN AWAY** - they were NOT eyewitnesses to the crucifixion!
- <span style="color:blue;">**Luke 23:49:**</span> "All his acquaintances stood at A DISTANCE, beholding these things"
- Even those who stayed watched from FAR AWAY - not close enough to verify who was actually crucified
- **Critical point:** If they fled and watched from a distance, how can they testify it was definitely Jesus on the cross?

## 🎯 Best Questions to Ask

1. If Jesus came to die for sins, why did he pray "let this cup pass from me" THREE times?
2. How were the people of Nineveh (120,000+) forgiven through repentance alone without blood sacrifice?
3. <span style="color:blue;">**Jesus said:**</span> "I desire mercy, not sacrifice" (Matthew 12:7) - doesn't that contradict the atonement doctrine?
4. How can punishing an innocent person (Jesus) for the guilty be just? Wouldn't that be corruption in any human court?

## 🕌 Islamic Position

<span style="color:green;">**[Quran 4:157-158]**</span>
> **Arabic:** وَمَا قَتَلُوهُ وَمَا صَلَبُوهُ وَلَٰكِن شُبِّهَ لَهُمْ ۚ وَإِنَّ الَّذِينَ اخْتَلَفُوا فِيهِ لَفِي شَكٍّ مِّنْهُ ۚ مَا لَهُم بِهِ مِنْ عِلْمٍ إِلَّا اتِّبَاعَ الظَّنِّ ۚ وَمَا قَتَلُوهُ يَقِينًا ﴿١٥٧﴾ بَل رَّفَعَهُ اللَّهُ إِلَيْهِ
>
> **Translation (Sahih International):** And they did not kill him, nor did they crucify him; but [another] was made to resemble him to them. And indeed, those who differ over it are in doubt about it. They have no knowledge of it except the following of assumption. And they did not kill him, for certain. Rather, Allah raised him to Himself.

<span style="color:green;">**[Quran 17:15]**</span>
> **Arabic:** مَّنِ اهْتَدَىٰ فَإِنَّمَا يَهْتَدِي لِنَفْسِهِ ۖ وَمَن ضَلَّ فَإِنَّمَا يَضِلُّ عَلَيْهَا ۚ وَلَا تَزِرُ وَازِرَةٌ وِزْرَ أُخْرَىٰ
>
> **Translation (Sahih International):** Whoever is guided is only guided for [the benefit of] his soul. And whoever errs only errs against it. And no bearer of burdens will bear the burden of another.

**Each soul responsible for its own deeds. No one can carry another's sins.**

- If Jesus was hungry, tired, ignorant, and tempted - he had HUMAN attributes, not divine attributes
- Therefore: Jesus cannot be God

### 2. **Jesus Called Himself a Prophet**
- <span style="color:blue;">**Jesus:**</span> "A prophet is not without honor, except in his own country" (Mark 6:4)
- <span style="color:blue;">**People:**</span> "This is the prophet Jesus of Nazareth" (Matthew 21:11)

### 3. **Jesus' Mission: Worship One God**
- <span style="color:blue;">**Jesus:**</span> "This is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent" (John 17:3)
- Jesus distinguished himself from God (the one who SENT him)

### 4. **Early Disciples Called Jesus "A MAN"**
- <span style="color:blue;">**Peter's speech (Acts 2:22, 33 CE):**</span> "Jesus of Nazareth, A MAN approved by God with mighty works...which GOD DID THROUGH HIM"
- <span style="color:blue;">**Acts 3:13, 22, 23, 26:**</span> Jesus called God's "SERVANT" and "PROPHET" - never "Son of God" or divine

### 5. **Jesus' Miracles Same as Earlier Prophets**
- Feeding multitudes: Jesus (5,000) / Elisha (100) - <span style="color:blue;">2 Kings 4:44</span>
- Healing lepers: Jesus / Elisha - <span style="color:blue;">2 Kings 5:14</span>
- Raising dead: Jesus / Elijah - <span style="color:blue;">1 Kings 17:22</span> / Elisha - <span style="color:blue;">2 Kings 4:34</span>
- **Elisha's BONES raised the dead** - <span style="color:blue;">2 Kings 13:21</span> - Greater than Jesus' miracles?

### 6. **Jesus Admitted Miracles Were From God**
- <span style="color:blue;">**Jesus:**</span> "I can of mine own self do NOTHING" (John 5:30)
- <span style="color:blue;">**Jesus:**</span> "If I with the FINGER OF GOD cast out devils..." (Luke 11:20)

## 🎯 Best Questions to Ask

1. If miracles prove divinity, why aren't Elijah, Elisha, and Moses considered divine?
2. Why did Jesus say "I can of mine own self do nothing" if he was God?
3. Why do the earliest Christian speeches (Acts 2-3) call Jesus "a man" and "prophet" but never "God"?

# TOPIC 5: Original Message of Jesus

## 📌 Their Core Claim
> "Jesus came to die for sins and establish a new covenant that replaces the Old Testament law."

## ⚡ Your Main Counter-Points

### 1. **Jesus DID NOT Abolish the Law**
- <span style="color:blue;">**Jesus:**</span> "Think NOT that I came to abolish the law...I came NOT to abolish but to fulfill. Till heaven and earth pass, not an iota, not a dot, will pass from the law" (Matthew 5:17-18)
- Heaven and earth haven't passed away!
- <span style="color:blue;">**Jesus:**</span> "Whosoever shall break one of these least commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the LEAST in the kingdom of heaven" (Matthew 5:19)
- Those who teach to break the law are LEAST in God's kingdom!

### 2. **Jesus Said: Keep Commandments for Eternal Life**
- <span style="color:blue;">**Jesus:**</span> "If you want to enter into life, KEEP THE COMMANDMENTS" (Matthew 19:17)
- No mention of "believe I'll die for your sins"

### 3. **PAUL (Not Jesus) Abolished the Law**
- <span style="color:blue;">**Paul:**</span> "We are discharged from the law" (Romans 7:6)
- <span style="color:blue;">**Paul:**</span> "Everyone that believes is freed from...the law of Moses" (Acts 13:39)
- Paul never met Jesus during his ministry!

# TOPIC 6: Prophecies of Muhammad

- Greek "allon" = another of the SAME KIND (a person like Jesus)
- <span style="color:blue;">**Jesus:**</span> "If I do not go away, the Counselor will NOT come" (John 16:7)
- But Holy Spirit was already present! (Luke 1:15, 41, 67) - So this must be someone else

### 2. **Prophet Like Moses (Deuteronomy 18:18)**
- <span style="color:blue;">**God:**</span> "I will raise up a prophet like you from among their BRETHREN"
- "Brethren" = Arabs (Ishmael's descendants, brother of Isaac)
- <span style="color:blue;">**God:**</span> "I will put my WORDS IN HIS MOUTH"
- Quran = Allah's literal words revealed to Muhammad

### 3. **Servant from Kedar (Isaiah 42:1, 11)**

### 2. **Jesus' Mission Upon Return**
- Break the cross (reject crucifixion narrative)
- Kill the pig (enforce pork prohibition)
- Fight to establish Islam

# TOPIC 8: Problem of Evil

## 📌 Their Core Claim
> "The existence of evil and suffering proves there is no all-powerful, all-good God."

## ⚡ Your Main Counter-Points

### 1. **God is Not ONLY Good and Powerful - He is AL-HAKEEM (The Wise)**
- Whatever Allah wills is in line with WISDOM
- Just because we don't see the wisdom doesn't mean it doesn't exist

### 2. **Story of Moses and Al-Khidr (Quran 18:65-82)**
- Al-Khidr damaged a ship → Wisdom: Saved it from being seized by a king
- Al-Khidr killed a boy → Wisdom: Would have caused parents to disbelieve; Allah replaced him with better
- Al-Khidr fixed a wall → Wisdom: Treasure beneath for orphan boys
- **Point:** What appears evil may serve greater good we cannot perceive

### 3. **God HAS Given Reasons for Evil/Suffering**
- **Reason 1:** Our primary purpose is worship, not worldly comfort
- **Reason 2:** This life is a TEST - trials are inevitable
- **Reason 3:** Evil is the EXCEPTION, not the rule (illness short-lived vs. health)
- **Reason 4:** Trials enable us to know God's attributes (The Healer, The Just)
- **Reason 5:** Suffering allows second-order good (courage requires danger, compassion requires suffering)
- **Reason 6:** Free will requires possibility of evil
- **Reason 7:** Ultimate justice in the afterlife

### 4. **Islam vs. Christianity on Evil**
| Aspect | Christianity | Islam |
|--------|-------------|-------|
| Origin | Adam's fall/original sin | Test of life; free will |
| Human nature | Corrupted by sin | Born in fitrah (natural goodness) |
| Framework | Mystery + cross | Multiple explicit reasons + wisdom |
| Afterlife | Salvation through Christ | Perfect justice for all |

## 🎯 Best Questions to Ask (To Christians)

1. If suffering is consequence of Adam's sin, why does a just God punish innocent children for their ancestor's mistake?
2. How does the cross solve ongoing suffering after Jesus' crucifixion?
3. If the answer is "mystery," how is that different from admitting you don't have an answer?

## 🎯 Turning Tables on Atheists

1. If there's no God, how can you call anything objectively evil?
2. Doesn't your outrage at injustice presuppose an objective standard that requires God?

# TOPIC 11: "Son of God"

## 📌 Their Core Claim
> "Jesus is called the 'Son of God,' which proves his unique divine nature."

## ⚡ Your Main Counter-Points

### 1. **Jesus NEVER Called Himself "Son of God"**
- Jesus repeatedly called himself "SON OF MAN" (Luke 9:22, etc.)
- <span style="color:blue;">**Luke 4:41:**</span> Demons called him "Son of God" - Jesus REBUKED them and "would not allow them to speak"

### 2. **MANY People Called "Son of God" in Bible**
- <span style="color:blue;">**Israel:**</span> "Israel is my FIRST-BORN son" (Exodus 4:22-23)
- <span style="color:blue;">**Solomon:**</span> "I will be his father, and he shall be my son" (2 Samuel 7:13-14)
- <span style="color:blue;">**David:**</span> "You are my son, today I have BEGOTTEN you" (Psalms 2:7)
- <span style="color:blue;">**Angels:**</span> "Sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord" (Job 1:6)
- <span style="color:blue;">**Adam:**</span> "The son of Adam, the son of God" (Luke 3:38)
- <span style="color:blue;">**Peacemakers:**</span> "They will be called sons of God" (Matthew 5:9)

### 3. **"Begotten" Also NOT Unique**
- <span style="color:blue;">**God to David:**</span> "You are my son, today I have BEGOTTEN you" (Psalms 2:7)
- Same language used for David as for Jesus!

### 4. **Earliest Christians Called Jesus "A MAN FROM GOD"**
- <span style="color:blue;">**Acts 2:22 (33 CE speech):**</span> "Jesus of Nazareth, A MAN FROM GOD"
- <span style="color:blue;">**Acts 3:13, 22, 23, 26:**</span> Jesus called "servant" and "prophet" - NOT "Son of God"
- This reflects ORIGINAL belief before Greek/Roman influence

## 🎯 Best Questions to Ask

1. If being called "son of God" makes Jesus divine, why aren't Israel, Solomon, David, Adam, and angels divine?
2. Jesus called himself "Son of Man" and rebuked those who called him "Son of God" (Luke 4:41) - why reject a title proving divinity?
3. Why do earliest Christian speeches call Jesus "a man from God" instead of "Son of God"?

# TOPIC 12: Most Misquoted Bible Verses

## 📌 The Issue
> Christians often cite verses to support Trinity, Jesus' divinity, or other doctrines - but context reveals they mean something entirely different.

## ⚡ Common Misquotations & Refutations

### 1. **"I and the Father are one" (John 10:30)**

**What Christians claim:** Proves Jesus is God, one substance with the Father.

**What it ACTUALLY means:**
- <span style="color:blue;">**John 17:21-22:**</span> Jesus prayed "that they [disciples] may be ONE, as we [Father and Son] are one...that they may be one EVEN AS WE ARE ONE"
- If "one" means same being, then ALL disciples = God too!
- Clearly means: **One in PURPOSE**, not one in essence
- <span style="color:blue;">**John 10:33-36:**</span> When Jews accused him of blasphemy, Jesus quoted Psalm 82:6 ("You are gods") - showing "son of God" is metaphorical language, not literal divinity claim

### 2. **"Before Abraham was, I am" (John 8:58)**

**What Christians claim:** "I AM" = God's name (Exodus 3:14), so Jesus claimed to be God.

**What it ACTUALLY means:**
- Greek: "egō eimi" = simply "I am" (common expression)
- Used by others without divine claim: Blind man says "egō eimi" (John 9:9) - is he God too?
- Jesus said: "Before Abraham was, I am", there is NO claim to BE God
- Many prophets pre-existed in God's knowledge (Jeremiah 1:5 - "Before I formed you in the womb I knew you")

### 3. **"In the beginning was the Word...and the Word was God" (John 1:1)**

**What Christians claim:** "Word" = Jesus, therefore Jesus is God.

**What it ACTUALLY means:**
- Greek: "kai theos ēn ho logos" - "and the Word was divine/godly" (NO definite article)
- Scholar's translation: "the Word was divine" (NOT "the Word was THE God")
- <span style="color:blue;">**John 1:1:**</span> "Word was WITH God" - How can Word BE God and be WITH God simultaneously?
- "Word" (Logos) = God's creative command, His wisdom - NOT a person
- <span style="color:blue;">**John 1:14:**</span> "Word became flesh" = God's command manifested in Jesus, like God's word through all prophets
- **"Logos" was adopted to match Greek philosophy:**
  - Greek philosophers (especially Philo of Alexandria and Stoics) used "Logos" to describe divine reason/intermediary between God and creation
  - John's Gospel written in Greek (90-110 CE) for Hellenistic audience - borrowed Greek philosophical concept to make Christianity appealing
  - This is Hellenization of Jesus' message - NOT what Jesus taught in Aramaic
  - Early Jewish-Christian groups (Ebionites, Nazarenes) rejected this Greek philosophical interpretation

### 4. **"My Lord and my God!" (John 20:28)**

**What Christians claim:** Thomas called Jesus "God," proving Jesus accepted worship as divine.

**What it ACTUALLY means:**
- Expression of astonishment (like "Oh my God!" today) - NOT worship
- Thomas didn't literally think Jesus was the Father (whom he called "God" separately)
- <span style="color:blue;">**John 20:17:**</span> Jesus JUST said "I am ascending to my Father and your Father, to MY GOD and your God"
- Jesus has a God = Jesus is NOT God
- If this proves divinity, why didn't Jesus confirm it? Instead he points to his own God!

### 5. **"No one comes to the Father except through me" (John 14:6)**

**What Christians claim:** Only those who believe Jesus is God/died for sins can be saved.

**What it ACTUALLY means:**
- Jesus = the way = following his MESSAGE and example
- <span style="color:blue;">**John 14:6:**</span> "I am the way, the TRUTH, and the life" - Truth and Life are metaphors; so is "the way"
- All prophets were "the way" for their people (Moses for Jews, etc.)
- Means: Follow Jesus' teaching of worshiping One God, keeping commandments
- <span style="color:blue;">**Matthew 7:21:**</span> "Not everyone who says 'Lord, Lord' will enter...but whoever DOES THE WILL of my Father"
- Salvation through OBEDIENCE to God, not just belief about Jesus

### 6. **"For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son" (John 3:16)**

**What Christians claim:** Jesus is God's unique, literally begotten divine son who died for sins.

**What it ACTUALLY means:**
- "Begotten" (Greek: monogenēs) = unique, one-of-a-kind, NOT literally born from God
- <span style="color:blue;">**Hebrews 11:17:**</span> Isaac called Abraham's "monogenēs" (only begotten) - yet Abraham had Ishmael!
- Means: unique or beloved, NOT biological sonship
- Many called "son of God" in Bible: Israel (Exodus 4:22), Solomon (2 Samuel 7:14), David (Psalm 2:7), Adam (Luke 3:38)
- "Gave his son" = sent as messenger, NOT sacrifice (context: verse 17 says "not to condemn but to save")

### 7. **"I am the Alpha and Omega" (Revelation 1:8)**

**What Christians claim:** Jesus is eternal like God, proving his divinity.

**What it ACTUALLY means:**
- <span style="color:blue;">**Revelation 1:8:**</span> "I am Alpha and Omega, says the LORD GOD" - God the Father speaking, NOT Jesus
- <span style="color:blue;">**Revelation 1:1:**</span> "Revelation of Jesus Christ, which GOD GAVE UNTO HIM" - God gives revelation TO Jesus (they're separate)
- When applied to Jesus (Rev 22:13), it's in the context of being first/last messenger for that era, NOT eternal God
- <span style="color:blue;">**Isaiah 44:6:**</span> "I am the first and the last" = God alone, not shared title

**Critical Problems with This Claim:**
1. **This is a VISION/DREAM of John, NOT Jesus' actual statement**
   - Revelation 22:13 occurs in John's vision - not Jesus walking around making this claim
   - Christians demand statements FROM Jesus himself, but this is John's dream/vision
   - Visions and dreams are not the same authority as direct statements

2. **"Alpha and Omega" = Eternality, but eternality alone does NOT prove divinity**
   - <span style="color:blue;">**Melchizedek (Hebrews 7:1-4):**</span> "Without father, without mother, without genealogy, having neither beginning of days nor end of life"
   - Melchizedek described as having NO beginning and NO end (eternal attributes)
   - Yet Melchizedek is NOT God and is NOT Jesus
   - If eternality proved divinity, Melchizedek would be God too!

3. **"First and Last" is about role/position, not eternality**
   - Could mean first and last messenger for a specific era or mission
   - Does not necessarily mean eternal existence
   - Context matters: Is this about temporal priority or ontological nature?

4. **Major contradiction: How can Jesus be "Alpha and Omega" if he has a beginning?**
   - <span style="color:blue;">**Revelation 3:14:**</span> Jesus is "the beginning of the creation of God"
   - <span style="color:blue;">**Colossians 1:15:**</span> Jesus is "the firstborn of all creation"
   - If Jesus is created/born, he has a beginning - contradicts being "Alpha" (no beginning)!

## 🎯 Best Questions to Ask

1. If "I and the Father are one" means same being, does Jesus' prayer that disciples "be one as we are one" make them God too?
2. Why did Jesus say "MY God" (John 20:17) if he himself is God?
3. If "son of God" is literal, why are Israel, Solomon, David, and Adam also called "sons of God"?
4. The blind man said "I am" (egō eimi) just like Jesus - does that make him divine too?

# TOPIC 13: Original Sin

## 📌 Their Core Claim
> "All humans are born sinful due to Adam's sin, and only Jesus' crucifixion can atone for this."

## ⚡ Your Main Counter-Points

### 1. **Original Sin is UNJUST**
- Would a loving father punish his great-great-grandchildren for his son's mistake?
- How can All-Just God punish billions for one man's sin?

### 2. **The Bible REJECTS Inherited Sin (7 Verses!)**
- <span style="color:blue;">**Ezekiel 18:20:**</span> "The son shall NOT bear the iniquity of the father"
- <span style="color:blue;">**Deuteronomy 24:16:**</span> "Fathers shall not be put to death for children...every man shall be put to death for his OWN sin"
- <span style="color:blue;">**Jeremiah 31:29-30:**</span> "Everyone shall die for his OWN sin"
- <span style="color:blue;">**2 Chronicles 25:4:**</span> Amaziah didn't kill children for fathers' sins "as written in the law of Moses"
- (+ 3 more similar verses)

### 3. **If Children Are Sinful, How Can Kingdom Belong to Them?**
- <span style="color:blue;">**Jesus:**</span> "Let the little children come to me...for the kingdom of heaven BELONGS TO SUCH AS THESE" (Matthew 19:14)
- Contradiction!

### 4. **Bible Calls People "PERFECT"**
- <span style="color:blue;">**Noah:**</span> "PERFECT in his generations...RIGHTEOUS" (Genesis 6:9, 7:1)
- <span style="color:blue;">**Job:**</span> "PERFECT and upright, feared God, shunned evil" (Job 1:1)
- How can they be perfect if all are born sinful?

### 5. **God Forgives Without Blood Sacrifice**
- Nineveh (120,000+): Forgiven through repentance and fasting (Jonah 3)
- Zacchaeus: "TODAY salvation has come" through repentance (Luke 19:9) - BEFORE crucifixion!
- <span style="color:blue;">**Jesus:**</span> "I desire MERCY, not sacrifice" (Matthew 12:7)

## 🎯 Best Questions to Ask

1. If a loving father wouldn't punish great-grandchildren for his son's mistake, how can God punish all humanity for Adam's sin?
2. The Bible says "the son shall NOT bear the iniquity of the father" (Ezekiel 18:20) - doesn't that contradict Original Sin?
3. If children are born sinful, how can Jesus say "the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these"?
4. The Bible calls Noah and Job "perfect" - how, if all humans are born sinful?

# TOPIC 14: Denominations

## 📌 Quick Denomination Notes for Dawah

### **Catholics**
- **Unique:** Pope, Mary veneration, 7 sacraments, purgatory, 73 books in Bible
- **Ask Filipinos:** "Holy Mary Mother of God" - If Mary is Mother of God, what is her son but a god?
- **Note:** Catholic law STILL requires women to cover heads in church

### **Protestants/Evangelicals**
- **Unique:** Sola Scriptura (Scripture alone), reject Pope/tradition
- **Dawah approach:** Must use Scripture only, not tradition
- **Note:** 66 books in Bible (7 fewer than Catholics) - they removed the "Apocrypha"

### **Born Again/Pentecostal**
- **Unique:** Speaking in tongues, baptism in Holy Spirit
- **Note:** Consider mainstream Christians as not "true" Christians

### **Jehovah's Witnesses**
- **Unique:** Jesus NOT God (just son of God), no hell, no eternal punishment
- **Major weakness:** Predicted end of world 6 times (1914, 1918, 1920, 1925, 1941, 1975) - ALL FAILED
- **Dawah approach:** Since they reject Trinity, focus on Muhammad's prophethood + failed prophecies

### **Seventh Day Adventists**
- **Unique:** Sabbath is Saturday, Ellen White is prophet, **NO PORK/ALCOHOL** (like Muslims!)
- **Dawah approach:** They already follow some Torah laws - ask why they pick some (dietary) but not others (circumcision)

### **Mormons (LDS)**
- **Unique:** Adam is God incarnate (!), God had physical relations with Mary (!), blacks excluded from temples until 1978 (racism!)
- **Major weakness:** Convenient "revelations" (about polygamy, about blacks) show human manipulation

## 🎯 Best Question for ALL Denominations

**"If the Bible is God's Word, why do Catholics have 73 books, Protestants have 66, and you disagree on core doctrines?"**
